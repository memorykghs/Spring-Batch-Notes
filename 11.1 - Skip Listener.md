# 11.1 - Skip Listener
8.2.3. Listening and logging skipped items
Okay, your job doesn’t fail miserably anymore because of a single incorrect line in your 500-megabyte input file, fine—but how do you easily spot these incorrect lines? One solution is to log each skipped item with the skip callbacks provided by Spring Batch. Once you have the skipped items in a file or in a database, you can deal with them: correct the input file, do some manual processing to deal with the error, and so on. The point is to have a record of what went wrong!

You can implement a skip listener and plug it into a step, as figure 8.4 shows. Spring Batch calls the appropriate method on the listener when it skips an item. To implement a skip listener, you can directly implement the SkipListener interface, but this implies implementing three methods, even if you expect skipped items only during the reading phase. To avoid implementing empty methods, you can inherit from the SkipListenerSupport adapter class, which provides no-op implementations: you override only the method you need.
